Junior Full-Stack Web Developer - Moveo
Loop Machine

Technical Details
This application was developed in React JS. 
I used javaScript and CSS Languages, and used react material UI for icons. The players in the list are built based on the playerArray passed to it, making it available for changes and easy to add or delete players. 
The player.js was built with javaScript class and used to manipulate user interaction based on HTMLAudioElements.
The range input slider moves as a reaction to the playerâ€™s currentTime.

Application Details
In the app, there are nine players that the user can interact with.
Each player represents different audio.
Above the players we have three buttons: 
Play- plays the audio.
Stop- stops the audio and returns the slider to the beginning.
Loop- toggles the loop option.
The vertical slider points to the current playing position.
The user has an option to mute\unmute each player. 
Because of time constraints I could not finish the bonus task, I preferred to fully complete all the mandatory tasks.

Summary
The assignment was very challenging. It took me about 3 days to finish.
In order to develop the app, I studied a lot of different subjects for the first time. I faced many obstacles through the development, requiring me to investigate and search for the right solution for me. 
I really enjoyed working on the assignment. It opened me to the web world which I was not familiar with until some time ago. Overall,  I'm satisfied with the result.
